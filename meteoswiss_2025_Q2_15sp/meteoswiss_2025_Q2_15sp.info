
This model was developed and trained by MeteoSwiss for use within the SwissPollen Monitoring Network. It is designed for pollen classification using SwisensPoleno (Jupiter) devices.

The model has been tested and validated exclusively under Swiss conditions for seven pollen taxa: Alnus, Betula, Corylus, Fagus, Fraxinus, Poaceae, and Quercus.
While the model technically includes a total of 15 classes, only the seven taxa listed above have been validated. The remaining classes have not been validated and may yield unreliable or inaccurate results.

Use of the model outside its intended scope — including applications in other geographic regions, for unvalidated taxa, or for operational decision-making — is not recommended.
